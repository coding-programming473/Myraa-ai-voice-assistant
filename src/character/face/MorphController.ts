/**
 * Unified morph channel.
 *
 * PMX models express expressions through three different morph kinds, and this
 * model uses all three. Vertex morphs map cleanly onto three.js morph targets;
 * bone morphs (which is how Evelyn's eyebrows move) and group morphs have no
 * three.js equivalent and are resolved here.
 *
 * Every system that wants to influence the face - blinking, expressions, lip
 * sync, behaviours - writes into the same accumulator each frame:
 *
 *     begin();  ...many add(name, weight) calls...  commit(...)
 *
 * Weights accumulate additively and are clamped once at commit time, so
 * several systems can drive the same morph (a smile from an expression plus a
 * smile from a behaviour) without fighting over it.
