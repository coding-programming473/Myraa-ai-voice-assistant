/**
 * Random behaviour scheduler.
 *
 * Picks spontaneous behaviours on a randomised interval so the character keeps
 * doing things on her own. Three rules keep it from feeling mechanical:
 *
 *   - intervals are random within a configured range, never fixed,
 *   - a behaviour cannot repeat until N others have played, so you don't see
 *     the same wave twice in a row,
 *   - selection is weighted and filtered by what she is currently doing, so
 *     she won't stretch mid-sentence or wave while thinking.
 *
 * Every behaviour is wrapped in a blend envelope that ramps its influence up
 * from zero and back down to zero. That envelope is the guarantee behind the
 * "no snapping" requirement: nothing a behaviour does is ever applied at full
 * strength instantaneously, and an interrupted behaviour releases smoothly
 * instead of being cut.
